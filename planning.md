# Chess Engine

## What is should do

- [ ] Be able to get the current state of the board.
- [ ] Be able to validate moves acording to piece type and board state.
- [ ] Be able to effect a move that will create a new board state.

## Hackday planning

- Make a chess game for the christmas party.

### Server logic

- Should allow people to play together.
  - The catch is there are multiple people in a single team. (eg. 4v4)
  - They take turns to make a move.
  - People can choose their team?
- Should be able to support multiple games at once.

### Frontend

- Should provide a mobile/web app that allows people to queue in.
- Should allow them to play the game and know when their turn comes.
- Should show the playing order.
- Create game history that people can see.
- Provide some kind of scoreboard.
  - Have people register?
  - Just enter a username?
  - Assign cookies and allow them to optionally pick a username?
